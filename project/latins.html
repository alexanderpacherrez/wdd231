            <h3>SEBASTIÁN YATRA</h3>
            <h4>HOMETOWN: Medellín, Colombia<br>BORN: October 15, 1994 - GENRE: Pop Latino</h4>
            <p>If there's anything that is necessary for a singer of romantic ballads, it's genuine thoughtfulness—and Sebastián Yatra has that in spades. 
            Born Sebastián Obando Giraldo in 1994 in Medellín, Colombia, Yatra moved to the U.S. at age five and grew up in what may be the world's most 
            creatively fertile city for Latin pop: Miami. Yatra began singing and writing his own songs when he was 12, taking classes to improve his 
            skills on guitar, piano, and voice. He had his first hit at age 19 with 2013's “El Psicólogo,” a charming acoustic ballad that detailed hidden 
            love and psychological complexity. It performed well in Colombia and Latin America, but to really ascend to Latin pop's heights, the singer 
            had to embrace the burgeoning pop-reggaetón scene. In 2017, he nailed it with the reggaetón- and EDM-brushed “Traicionera,” which retained 
            the powerful sweetness of his vocal delivery but gave fans the tropical beats they craved. Partly on the strength of that single, his 2018 
            debut album, Mantra, topped charts in Colombia and the Latin Pop Albums chart in the U.S. Collaborators came knocking, including Colombian 
            superstar Carlos Vives, who brought Yatra onto the vallenato-tinged “Robarte un Beso.” In 2019, Yatra followed up his successful first album 
            with Fantasía, which spawned many singles and established him as an ongoing force in Latin pop.</p>

            <h3>PISO 21</h3>
            <h4>GENRE: Pop Latino</h4>
            <p>Mixing sleek hi-hat patterns with graceful guitar melodies, Piso 21, along with fellow Medellín artists KAROL G, Maluma, and J Balvin, added
             an urban edge to Colombian pop. The foursome was founded in 2007 when Pablo “Pablito” Mejía, Juan David “El Profe” Huertas, David “Dim” Escobar, 
             and David “Lorduy” Hernández met at a friend's party. Their band name was inspired by the fact that the festive gathering was held at a 21st-floor 
             apartment. Piso 21 took their time before releasing their well-received eponymous full-length debut, a soothing, sun-kissed, guitar-laden album, 
             in 2012. They drew even more widespread recognition after pivoting toward a more street-style sound with 2014's “Suele Suceder,” featuring 
             Puerto Rican singer and reggaetón royalty Nicky Jam. The sonic shift couldn't have been timed better as it put the band in the forefront of the 
             reggaetón explosion that within three years would see the success of Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee's worldwide hit “Despacito.” That year, the 
             troupe signed with Warner Music, dropped “Me Llamas,” the theme song for Colombian telenovela series La ley del corazón, and demonstrated their 
             sensual trap bravado in their sophomore album, 2018's Ubuntu, by introducing atmospheric synths to their club-ready sound. Where Piso 21 will 
             go next musically is impossible to predict but exciting to imagine.</p>

            <h3>CHRISTIAN NODAL</h3>
            <h4>HOMETOWN: Caborca, Sonora, México<br>BORN: MJanuary 11, 1999 - GENRE: Música Mexicana</h4>
            <p>Christian Nodal has mixed feelings about the modern world. On the one hand, he probably wouldn't have his career without it—a fact to which his millions of heart-emoji-posting 
            social-media followers can attest. On the other, his is an art forged deeply in the past, a gentle pushback against contemporary sounds in favor of older styles of Mexican music 
            combined in novel but reverential ways. His fans see him as the great hope of regional Mexican, an artist keeping the flame of tradition alive for listeners on both sides of the border. 
            To Nodal, he's just an old man in a young man's body.<br>
            Born in 1999 in the Sonoran city of Caborca, bordering Arizona, he started playing music as a child and was writing his own songs by middle school. His highlights—“Aquí Abajo,” 
            “No Te Contaron Mal,” “Adiós Amor,” “Te Fallé”—channel the romanticism of classic Mexican singers like Vicente Fernández and Juan Gabriel, but also reflect a clever blend of 
            styles: mariachi, norteño, cumbia, even country. He's not trying to cross over. But as demographics change, Nodal has gained a foothold with Latinx communities everywhere, not 
            by assimilating his sound, but by keeping it pure.</p>
