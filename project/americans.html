            <h3>THE CHAINSMOKERS</h3>
            <h4>ORIGIN: New York, NY, United States<br>FORMED: 2012 - GENRE: Dance</h4>
            <p>“Everything starts with the song,” The Chainsmokers' Andrew Taggart tells Apple Music. 
            “That's the most important thing to us.” Taggart and his music partner Alex Pall got their start in EDM, but they found
            their calling as hitmaking multi-hyphenates—producers, songwriters, and collaborators with unerring instincts for
            pop that moves both hips and heart. Taggart and Pall met through their future manager in 2012, and in 2014, 
            they went viral with “#SELFIE,” a social-media satire accompanied by an earthshaking drop. They spent the next 
            couple of years headlining increasingly bigger stages, but with 2016's “Roses” and “Don't Let Me Down,” 
            they flipped the script, using trap-infused future bass as the springboard for featured singers ROZES and Daya. 
            It was 2016's “Closer,” Taggart's debut as a singer, that sealed their rep as next-gen visionaries: 
            A nostalgic duet with Halsey, the song showcased not just The Chainsmokers' versatility but also their 
            knack for distilling wide-screen emotions into a single devastating verse. On their 2017 debut album, 
            Memories…Do Not Open, they leaned into that sensitivity, chronicling a Bonnie-and-Clyde romance on “Paris” 
            and bringing their signature synths to the Coldplay collab “Something Just Like This.” Since then, The Chainsmokers 
            have turned into one of pop's most industrious acts, trickling out monthly singles—both 2018's Sick Boy and 2019's 
            World War Joy were assembled from those drops—and working with newcomers like Lennon Stella and icons like blink-182. 
            “There's a lot of thought put into not only who can sing this the right way,” says Taggart, but also “what's an 
            interesting collaboration—what's going to be a new flavor that we've never had before.”"</p>

            <h3>HARRY STYLES</h3>
            <h4>HOMETOWN: Redditch, England<br> BORN: February 1, 1994 - GENRE: Pop</h4>
            <p>Not everyone gets famous as a teenager—and even fewer escape the experience intact. So congratulations to Harry Styles, 
            who would've been fine had he retired after One Direction but instead went on to become one of the more interesting and 
            adventurous pop stars of his era. “I think there's a lot of things that used to feel like, Okay, there's a part of your life, 
            then there's a hard stop, then there's a next part of your life,” he told Apple Music around the release of 2022's Grammy-winning
            Harry's House. “Things that used to feel so unbelievably foreign to me, sort of terrifying—like, I'm not 19 anymore, 
            so I'm less terrified. And realizing [life's] just one thing, and not chapter over, bye-bye.” Perspective: It helps, 
            whether you're out there in front of 50,000 people or performing the very first Apple Music Live session. Part of what made 
            One Direction great was that they never shied away from the pleasures of boy-band pop but never patronized their audiences, 
            either: Never mind the no-dancing policy; they wrote their own songs and cultivated their own musical perspectives. 
            Beyond his precision-tooled indie-curious pastiche of classic pop, soft-rock, psychedelia, and soul, Styles' lyrics capture 
            a playfulness and emotional specificity that feels unusual for pop so big, whether it's the flirtation of “Music for 
            a Sushi Restaurant” (“Green eyes/Fried rice/I could cook an egg on you”) or the image of a kid outrunning an unhappy 
            home on “Matilda” (“You were riding your bike to the sound of 'It's No Big Deal'”). That life he's pontificating about? 
            Listen to the music and you can almost hear him living it.</p>

            <h3>MAROON 5</h3>
            <h4>ORIGIN: Los Angeles, CA, United States<br> FORMED: 2001 - GENRE: Pop</h4>
            <p>When the video for Maroon 5's “This Love” hit MTV in 2004, the network censored two words: coming, as in “keep her coming every night,” 
            and sinking, as in “sinking my fingertips into every inch of you.” It's not that the words were dirty, of course, but the context—well, 
            even as euphemism, they felt a little too R for a song so universally catchy, so G. The incident was, in a way, a precedent: Even as they 
            ascended to megastardom, Maroon 5 has managed to retain a sense of edge and sexuality that seems incomparable with how huge they are, 
            bringing the boudoir to the grocery store while simultaneously remaining one of the 21st century's few mainstream bands—as in, that old-timey 
            concoction of guitar, bass, drums, and a singer—able to keep pace with the innovations of electronic music and hip-hop. <br>
            Made up primarily of old high-school friends, the band formed in Los Angeles in the early 2000s after an earlier—and musically unrelated—incarnation 
            called Kara's Flowers failed to launch. Influenced by singer Adam Levine's then-recent baptism in hip-hop music and culture, 2002's Songs About Jane 
            was a slow burn, taking about two years to reach the upper end of the charts. The band toured relentlessly, venturing further into soul 
            and Prince-style pop-rock for 2007's It Won't Be Soon Before Long, adding both polish and power for 2010's Hands All Over. In 2011, 
            Levine started serving as a coach on The Voice, launching his own celebrity while expanding the band's reach even further..</p>

            <h3>BRUNO MARS</h3>
            <h4>BORN: October 8, 1985 - GENRE: Pop</h4>
            <p>Bruno Mars has a good story about Prince: Mars is hanging out at an awards show, during a commercial break. The crowd is filled with celebrities. 
            Suddenly, Mars feels the room shift, people part, and there he is, Mars told Apple Music in a 2016 interview—Prince, “just floating by, levitating by.” 
            Prince catches Mars' eye and gives him a thumbs-up, and Mars—stunned—gives Prince a thumbs-up back. “And that's it,” Mars said. “What more can you ask?”
            More than a Prince cosign? How about a stack of multiplatinum records? The privilege of being able to entertain people the world over? Mars has those too. 
            But you get the sense that the nod from Prince was affirmation of a higher order. Even when he was living on instant ramen noodles and trying to find 
            his way into the industry, Mars knew he didn't just want to be a songwriter or a singer or a producer, but—like Prince, or maybe Michael Jackson—a total 
            pop package, the kind of artist who's as powerful in the studio as they are onstage. Those records, though: “Uptown Funk,” “Locked Out of Heaven,” 
            “That's What I Like.” Fun, omnivorous, generation-bridging. The kind of stuff that Mom will be pulling you onto the dance floor for. Mars could do old-fashioned 
            showmanship, could credibly play the crooner with a live band to boot. But he also had an ear for hip-hop and R&B, could—like all great pop—collapse 
            the distance between then and now, Black music and white. Most of all, he knew how much retro was retro enough: Music that made you think about the past, 
            not pine for it.<br>
            Born Peter Hernandez in Honolulu in 1985, Mars took the stage early, famously doing Elvis impersonations with a family revue at a local hotel before he even 
            hit kindergarten. (In one formative moment, young Mars wet his jumpsuit during “Can't Help Falling In Love,” but finished without flinching.) As a teenager, 
            he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a deal with Motown Records. The deal went nowhere, but Mars kept himself afloat by writing and producing with a team called 
            The Smeezingtons, which he helped found. In 2010, he released his debut, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. By 2012's Unorthodox Jukebox, the image had gotten a little 
            grittier, the sound a little more diverse, and the retro affectations—goodbye, pompadour—a little less pronounced. Leaning on the slick bounce of '80s and '90s 
            funk and R&B, 24K Magic followed in 2016, sweeping its nominations at the Grammys.<br>
            A confessed perfectionist, Mars pushes on. “All the statues or Time magazine—that s**t is beautiful and made my parents and my family proud and all that,” 
            he told Apple Music. “But there's this battle within—that you always wanna. You got this fighter's spirit. I still feel like I'm chasing to prove something 
            to myself, that I got a better song in me.”</p>

            <h3>MAGIC!</h3>
            <h4>ORIGIN: Toronto, Ontario, Canada<br> FORMED: 2012 - GENRE: Pop</h4>
            <p>Reggae-fusion band Magic! blend old-school reggae influences with elements of rock and pop for a distinctive and catchy take on a classic sound.<br>
            • Magic! grew out of a studio collaboration between singer Nasri Atweh and guitarist Mark Pellizzer, who were part of a group that worked together on the 2012 song 
            “Don't Judge Me” for the R&B singer Chris Brown.<br>
            • Though all four members of Magic! are from the Toronto area, the band formed in Los Angeles in 2012 after Atweh proposed a band that sounded “like a modern-day Police” to Pellizzer.<br>
            • The quartet's first single, 2013's “Rude,” is about a young man asking his girlfriend's father for permission to marry her—and being rejected. 
            The song was a global hit, climbing into the upper reaches of pop charts across Latin America and Europe and peaking at No. 1 in the US.<br>
            • Magic! backed Shakira on her song “Cut Me Deep,” from her self-titled LP in 2014, and contributed to the David Guetta track “Sun Goes Down” on his 2014 album Listen.<br>
            • Atweh and Adam Messinger comprised the production duo The Messengers before Atweh started Magic! with Pellizzer. Messinger has cowritten songs on the first three Magic! albums, which he also coproduced.</p>
